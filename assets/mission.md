> ‚ÄúMy central claim in this book is that these two trends‚Äîoverprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world‚Äîare the major reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation.‚Äù

We live in a digital age where technology has reshaped nearly every aspect of our daily lives.

While this technological revolution has brought countless benefits, it has also introduced significant challenges‚Äîparticularly in how it affects focus, well-being, and the development of children and adolescents.

That‚Äôs where **[Shortcutomation](https://shortcutomation.com)** comes in: **help people take back their time**, by simplifying digital routines using Ô£ø Apple Shortcuts.

We believe a world where your phone *serves* you, not *distracts* you.

A world without cluttered apps.
A world free of mindless doomscrolling.
A world where people click less, scroll less, type less.
A world where everyone lives a calmer, more present and intentional life‚Äîfocused on what truly matters in the real world.
