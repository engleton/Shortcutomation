title: ⚡ What is Shortcuts?
---

Shortcuts is a powerful app built into Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc.) that lets you create custom automations, with One Single Tap.

According to [Apple’s official guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios), “A shortcut provides a quick way to get things done with your apps, with just a tap or by asking Siri. The Shortcuts app lets you create your own shortcuts with multiple steps."

Whether you want to _open your favorite playlist_, _schedule Reminders_, _batch-edit photos_, _get directions to the next event on your Calendar_, or even _generate expense reports_―Shortcuts makes it possible. All from the device in your _pocket_.

With **Shortcuts**, the potential is pretty much **endless**!
